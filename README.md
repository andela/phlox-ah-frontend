## Purpose of Authors Haven
The purpose of this product is to build a platform where authors of like-minded can foster inspiration and share ideas through the web. It allows authors to connect, giving it a social network feel. Users can read great ideas shared by authors without even having an account. As a signed in user, you can do more than just read great articles, you can contribute by commenting, liking or disliking the article and when you come across articles that blow your mind but you don't want to keep it to yourself, you can share it to your friends in other social media and you can also bookmark the article for future reference. If you don't like the hustle of sign up with your email and going back to your mail to verify your account, we got you covered. You can sign up with your Google, Facebook and Twitter account in one click of a button. As a user, you also report articles you feel are not appropriate. You can set your preferred categories so that we can keep you up to date with articles that interest you.
